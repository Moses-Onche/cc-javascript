# Code Campus - JavaScript Class

JavaScript is a beautiful language. The web massively adopted this language and it is no mistake. And despite being so messy it is still more relevant today. It never comes up in conversations about what programming language is best for a beginner for a variety of reasons. But it is a force to reckon with. It is ridiculously broad and difficult to teach in a short time frame. My time teaching it left me with one conclusion. If you focus on its mess, you will get its mess. But if you focus on its power, then you will get powerful. As said in a 'Programmers Are Also Human' video:

```
Should you learn JavaScript? Nope.
Is there any other option? Nope.
```
